#README
This is the README file for the project "Identification and Classification of Mindanao Bird Species using Convolutional Neural Network". This project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and classify bird species found in Mindanao.

#Overview
This project uses a CNN to classify different species of birds found in Mindanao. The ResNet model was used to classify the birds, and the model was trained using a dataset of bird images. The project also includes a backend for deployment.

#Role
The following roles were carried out in this project:

- ResNet model development
- Backend development and deployment
